# Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/unconfirm/fork )
2. Create your feature/bug/refactor branch.
   - If its a bug-fix, create bug branch: bug/<issue-number> or bug/<issue-short-description>
   - If its a new feature, create a feature branch:  feature/<feature-short-description>
   - If its code refactoring with no changes to behavior: refactor/<refactoring-short-goals>
    (`git checkout -b <feature/bug/refacator>/my-branch` - we'll use `feature/my-feature` as
    an example in the rest of this section.)
3. Ensure that there are tests to assert that your changes are working as expected.
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -a`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin feature/my-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
